**Awareness project about smart and data-driven trading for aspiring traders using visual communication and digital marketing.**

---

## 💡 Project Idea  
**SnipeCharts** is an academic awareness project that aims to simplify and clarify the world of trading and investing for beginners.  
The project highlights the common struggles new traders face — conflicting analyses, unreliable tools, and emotional decision-making — and presents a new, data-driven perspective through the **SnipeCharts ecosystem**.

The project focuses on creating a **comprehensive awareness and educational campaign** that includes:

- Building a strong **brand identity** (logo, colors, tone, and visual style).  
- Producing **visual content** for social media (posts, carousels, videos, storytelling campaigns).  
- Creating a free **practical trading course** to help traders analyze the market using **real data and volume**, not guesswork.  
- Presenting the **SnipeCharts Indicator**, a free analytical tool that simplifies chart reading and helps users make data-based decisions.  
- Building an active **community** for traders to share experiences, discuss analyses, and learn together in a transparent environment.

This project transforms complex financial and analytical concepts into engaging, accessible visuals and narratives — empowering beginners to trade with confidence and awareness.
